# StackOverflow API


This app lets the users submit a topic theyâ€™re interested in and then display results of these queries.  
The second feature for this page gives the users ability to search for the top StackOverflow answerers for particular topics.    
This app is built using HTML5, CSS# and jQuery. The app makes an AJAX call to the appropriate endpoint on the StackExchange API.
